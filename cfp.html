		<p align="justify">Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite communication and networking is a rapidly growing field with
great potential for enabling new and innovative applications by providing low-latency,
high-bandwidth Internet connectivity globally. Massive-scale LEO deployments from industrial
players, such as Starlink, OneWeb, etc. have allowed wide-scale availability of LEO satellite
network access globally but their network remains to operate as a black box. However,
considering the state of LEO networking and constellation design is still in its infancy, we believe
that the unique challenges posed by the inherently dynamic LEO satellite architectures,
necessitate novel solutions in network architecture, protocol design, resource management,
along with several other verticals.</p>
		
            <p align="justify">LEONET 2023 invites submissions from researchers and practitioners in academia and industry
who are exploring the latest developments and open challenges in LEO satellite networks and
communications. We also welcome work-in-progress and position papers that present new
directions, highly original ideas, or have the potential to provoke insightful discussions during
the workshop. Whether you're an expert or a newcomer to the field, we encourage you to join us
		    and contribute to this exciting area of research.</p>
		    
	       		<p align="justify">As such, the scope of this workshop includes (but is not limited to) the following topics.<br/></p>

            <br/>
		<p><b> Submission Guidelines </b><br/>

<p>Submissions must be original, unpublished work, and not currently under consideration elsewhere. Submitted papers must be no longer than five (5) pages, including all figures, tables, followed by 1 page references. Submission should be single PDF file with all fonts embedded, in two-column 10pt ACM format with authors names and affiliations for double-blind peer review. Prospective authors are encouraged to use the same PDF formatting guidelines as the [main conference](https://sigmobile.org/mobicom/2023/cfp.html). Authors of accepted papers are expected to present their work at the workshop. Accepted papers will be published in the MobiCom Workshop Proceedings, and available at the ACM Digital Library.</p>

<p>You may find these [templates](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template) useful in complying with the above requirements. For Latex users, please use *\documentclass[sigconf, 10pt, anonymous]{acmart}*. But as an author, you bear the final responsibility to verify (manually or through the above online paper checker) that your submission is format-compliant.</p>
